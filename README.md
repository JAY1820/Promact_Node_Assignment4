# Express App with EJS
This is a simple Express application that uses EJS as the template engine.

## Why EJS?

EJS, or Embedded JavaScript, is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It's used in Node.js applications to create dynamic content on the webpage using server-side rendering.

Here are some benefits of using EJS:
- Simplicity: EJS uses plain JavaScript, which means you don't have to learn a new syntax.
- Flexibility: You can write any JavaScript code inside EJS templates.
- Speed: EJS is fast because it compiles the templates into plain JavaScript functions.

## Other Template Engines

There are several other template engines available for Node.js, such as Pug (formerly Jade), Mustache, Handlebars, Dust.js, Nunjucks, LiquidJS, and Twing. Each of these template engines has its own strengths and use-cases. The choice of a template engine depends on the specific requirements of your project.

## How to Start the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Start the server:
```bash

```

3. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
